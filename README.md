About This Repository
This repository serves as my portfolio of machine learning (ML) projects, built entirely with TypeScript. It showcases my ability to build functional, well-structured, and production-ready AI applications from concept to implementation. The projects here focus on applying ML in a web environment, leveraging the power of TypeScript for clean, safe, and maintainable code.

Featured Projects
1. Real-time Image Classifier üñºÔ∏è
A web application that can classify images in real-time directly in your browser. This project uses a pre-trained model with TensorFlow.js and transfer learning, demonstrating my understanding of computer vision and its integration on the client side.

Technologies: TensorFlow.js, React

Key Feature: On-the-fly image analysis without the need to send data to a server.

Status: Complete, ready for demonstration.

2. Text Sentiment Analyzer üí¨
A robust and responsive sentiment analysis tool, built to process and interpret the emotional tone of text. This project is highly relevant for analyzing product reviews, customer feedback, or social media data.

Technologies: TensorFlow.js, HTML/CSS/JS

Key Feature: High accuracy in distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Status: Complete.

3. Movie Recommendation API üé¨
A Node.js-based API that provides personalized movie recommendations. This project demonstrates my understanding of building efficient and scalable recommendation systems, a crucial feature for many modern entertainment platforms.

Technologies: Node.js, TensorFlow.js, Express.js

Key Feature: Recommendations based on user viewing history and preferences.

Status: Complete.
