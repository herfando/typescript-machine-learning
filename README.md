About This Repository
This repository serves as my portfolio of machine learning projects, built entirely with TypeScript. It showcases my ability to build functional, well-structured, and production-ready AI applications on both the frontend and backend.

The main goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my skills in:

Integrating ML models into web applications.

Building efficient AI solutions with clean and maintainable code.

Utilizing modern tools and frameworks for ML development.
